# List of supressions for leak sanitizer

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT add blank lines between the script,
# it seems that gcc sanitizer does not support that.

# At this point there are leaks from the runtimes but
# I am not sure all of them are due to metacall (probably
# some of them are due to GC errors but not all of them).
# We disable them until we debug those cases (if any) in depth.
