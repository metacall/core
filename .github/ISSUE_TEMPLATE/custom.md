Hey there and thank you for using Github Issues!

Our project, as you've probably heard, is getting really popular and truth is we're getting a bit overwhelmed by the activity surrounding it. There are just too many issues for us to manage properly.

Do the checklist before filing an issue:

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Create an apt issue and send us a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
- [ ] Have an usage question? Ask it on [Discussions](https://github.com/metacall/core/discussions/new) or community chats. We use Github Discussions for usage questions and GitHub Issues for bugs.
- [ ] Have an idea for a feature? Use the feature issue and propose your ideas. 

None of the above, create a custom issue

Make sure to add **all the information needed to help us understand what you wish to convey** so that someone can help.
